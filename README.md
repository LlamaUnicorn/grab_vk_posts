# grab_vk_posts
Grabs vk community posts: text and images. Then stores them in the separate folders.

This code appears to be using the VK (Vkontakte) API to fetch information from a group's wall and save it to a text file and a JSON file. It also appears to be downloading an image from the wall post.

Here are some potential areas for improvement:

    It might be a good idea to wrap the code in a function to make it more modular and easier to reuse.
    The code could benefit from some additional comments to explain what is happening at each step.
    It might be a good idea to handle errors more gracefully, for example by using try-except blocks to catch exceptions.
    It might be a good idea to consider using a VK API library such as vk-api instead of making raw HTTP requests to the API. This can simplify the code and make it easier to use.
    The code currently hardcodes the values for NUMBER_OF_POSTS_TO_GET and OFFSET, which could make the code inflexible. It might be a good idea to make these values configurable through function arguments or through some other means.
    The code currently relies on an environment variable TOKEN to authenticate with the VK API. It might be a good idea to consider using an alternative method of storing and retrieving sensitive information such as API keys.
    The code currently saves the image to a fixed file name ("sample_image3.png"). It might be a good idea to consider using a more descriptive or unique file name to avoid overwriting existing files.
    The code currently saves the image to the current working directory. It might be a good idea to consider specifying a different location to save the image, or to make the location configurable through function arguments or some other means.
